# My Awesome Project
This is a web application to coordinate and plan game nights with a group supporting video games, boardgames, and TTRPGs. Users can vote on what activities they would like to do and after a specified date the votes are collected and tallied.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** 
Front-End: HTML, CSS, Javascript, EJS, Materialize
Back-end: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose

The application uses MongoDB to collect user data and inputs to generate 'Game Nights' that can be shared with users. Invited users who accept can leave comments and vote on the proposed events to be held. All serverside requests are handeled via Node.js using MVC architecture and presented to the user vis EJS templates.

## Optimizations
I would like to add various voting methods such as ranked choice to give groups more control over how the chosen game will be selected.

A user profile page where users can customize their profile and share what games they have voted on and played.

## Lessons Learned:

This was a very exciting and fun experience working with more back-end frameworks and building out a user based application. I have developed a much deeper understanding of database manipulation and server calls and look forward to leveraging this to build this and other apps with greater scopes and functions.
